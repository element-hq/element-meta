## Keyboard shortcuts

When adding or removing keyboard shortcuts, the following should be considered:
* Does the shortcut clash with any OS shortcuts? (Windows, macOS or Linux)
* Does the shortcut clash with any browser shortcuts? (Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari)
* Is the shortcut accessible?
* Is the shortcut familiar to users?

New shortcuts must bring added value to most users and, where possible, be familiar to users from other apps.
